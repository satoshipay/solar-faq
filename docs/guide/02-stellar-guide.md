## Cryptocurrency

The basic currency used on the Stellar network is called "lumens" and is mostly represented with the following ticker: "XLM".

### Exchanges

You can convert lumens into most currencies in the world through online digital currency exchanges. Find a full list of Stellar exchanges on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/#markets).

## Minimum Account Balance

There is a minimum balance of lumens for every stellar account. Any transaction that would reduce an account’s balance to less than the minimum will be rejected with an INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE error.

Use the following formula to calculate the minimum account balance for your account:

(2 + # of entries) × 0.5 XLM\
Examples of entries: trustlines, offers, signers and data entries
