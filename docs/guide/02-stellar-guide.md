### Exchanges

You can convert lumens into most currencies in the world through online digital currency exchanges. Find a full list of Stellar exchanges on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/#markets).

## Minimum Account Balance

There is a minimum balance of lumens for every stellar account. Any transaction that would reduce an account’s balance to less than the minimum will be rejected with an INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE error.

Use the following formula to calculate the minimum account balance for your account:

(2 + # of entries) × 0.5 XLM\
Examples of entries: trustlines, offers, signers and data entries

## Multisignature

\
Signatures are used for authorizing transactions on the Stellar network. Most transactions only require authorization from one signature from an account. There are however situations when transactions require more than one signatures, e.g. when the transaction has operations that affect more than one account. "Multi-signature" refers to a situation in which more than one signatures are required for authorization of a transaction. Click the following link to learn more about multi-signature:\
