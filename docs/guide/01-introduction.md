## About Solar Wallet

## The reason why it is free

At SatoshiPay we needed an easy-to-use Stellar wallet for all major platforms that offered enterprise-grade security features. So we built it. The wallet is 100% free (and the core product will remain so), but in future we might add enterprise features, which will come at a cost.

## Exchange my lumens to fiat

It is very simple to convert the lumens you receive from customers into your local currency. All you need is a digital currency exchange. You can find a list of digital currency exchanges on coinmarketcap.com.

If you have any further questions on how to convert your lumens into your local currency, feel free to send an email to hello@satoshipay.io. We will be happy to give you some advice.

## Privacy and Security

### Security of the funds in the wallet

No. Your secret ID/private key is never disclosed to anyone, not even to us. Without the private key, no one will ever be able to control the funds in your wallet.
