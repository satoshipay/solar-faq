In order to activate your wallet for transactions, it is necessary to send at least 1 XLM to the wallet. 

If you are a registered SatoshiPay publisher, you can simply put in the public key of your empty wallet as your payout address. Our system will automatically activate your wallet by sending you 1 XLM.
